# Selfdrive_by_ML_CV
 This project is scripts for selfdriving contest at SKKU from 30/12/22 to 09/02/23

This repository contains scripts for an autonomous driving car. The code uses two different approaches to achieve autonomous driving: machine learning and computer vision. The machine learning code captures individual frames and trains a model using them, while the computer vision code uses computer vision techniques to drive the car. Both approaches have been implemented for autonomous driving, however, the validation accuracy of the machine learning model was not satisfactory, so the car was driven using the computer vision code. The machine learning was based on the autonomous driving sequence from Udacity.

Specific descriptions for codes are written on their folders.
